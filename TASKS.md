- [] Implement a working sound manager that allows adding, playing and stopping sounds without manually using raylib functions for sounds.
    - [] Implement indexing a map or something that is like a dict in zig using strings instead of i32 for acquiring a specific sound that is inside of that storage.
    - [] Add error handling for adding sounds that already exists in the storage, and then also for if the name isnt in the storage then error out.
