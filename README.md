Apple Catcher
- A simple catching game where the player needs to catch apples falling from a tree with a basket. 
- The  game becomes harder as the player goes up by one level. 
- The main objective of the game is to collect as much apple as possible and to fill the gauge up on top of the screen to win a level, as the game goes on, it will become harder to fill the gauge as the fall speed of the falling apples will become faster than before.
- On the main menu, the player can either sell the apples in the marketplace, on which would be where the other gameplay would happen:

The player will need to sell as much apple as they can by

I have implemented a simple movement code for the basket by using velocity and added clamping to screen edges to prevent the basket to go offscreen. I will soon start implementing the spawner for the apples which would include randomly generate positions of the apples that would be spawned, a limitter to prevent more apples to spawn, a despawning of the fall down apples to allow new ones to respawn until the gauge up on top of the screen is filled by catching more apples that fall down using the basket.

The gauge that I mentioned would act as the scoring system for this game -- or I could make it so that the guage would be a timer and the scoring system would be a different case. The player is expected to catch as many apples as possible before the gauge runs out. These are just suggestions for the time being but here's one that I think would be good:

- There would also be some kind of ranking system on which is based on the score that the player got after the end of each level. 

This would allow more dynamics to the game in addition to the other extra gameplay wherein the player needs to sell the apples (As I stated, the marketplace gameplay is also a suggestion, not a final feature.)
