I have finish making a working basket - apple collision using AABB Collision Detection (well I just transfered it over from odin to zig), after that I have implemented also a simple scoring for the player that track how many apples they have already has caught, each apple is equivalent to 1 point. 

I am now working on the difficulty system of the game and also on the polish part -- which is adding sound effects to other parts like the bg music, etc. After a while of working on these I will work on the menus next as part of the extra feature that isnt needed in the MVP, but they aren't required to be made yet so I will put it off for a while until I have a working MVP that has the core features of an apple catcher game.

I have fixed the problem of loading too many textures for one type of object by making the texture a shared texture, and have finish slightly the lose state of the game wherein, I decided to make it, if 5 or more apples are missed then game over. 
I didn't really test it much, though its just simple so yeah, but next thing I will work on is the sfx for missed  apples, and the game over screen. But there's already code for restarting so yeah, that will come in handy later on.

And then as for the state of the whole game, I think its almost ready for shipment and publish I guess (well I think its best to put it on itch.io as one of my game, as it's just a simple game), after that I plan on enhancing it more if the game would attract player's (heh, I hope so), that way they will some kind of unique experience for my. BUT, until then, that would be the final MVP of the game.
